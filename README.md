# Email-Parsing
There is a data set provided from which you parse the email id of the users.
# Open the file mbox-short.txt and read it line by line.
# When you find a line that starts with 'From ' like the following line:
# From (stephen.marquard@uct.ac.za Sat Jan  5 09:14:16 2008)
# You will parse the From line using split() and print out the second word in the line
# (i.e. the entire address of the person who sent the message).
# Then print out a count at the end.
